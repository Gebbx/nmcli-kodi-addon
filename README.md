# nmcli AddOn: WIFI v1.2.0
this AddOn is a network-manager frontend for kodi


i work with a debian based linux(MX) and kodi 19

it should work with all debian based linux distributions if 'nmcli'-command is availible.

this only works with network-manager installed

Requirements:

    sudo apt install -y network-manager
--------------------------------------------------

Download plugin.program.wifi.zip
and install it in kodi
